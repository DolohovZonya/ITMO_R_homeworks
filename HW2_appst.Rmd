#During this analysis, we explored various clustering methods and distances on
#the Golub gene expression dataset. We began by visualizing the mean gene expression values
#and applied a logarithmic transformation to the data before calculating distance matrices. 
#We considered three different distance metrics: Manhattan, Canberra, and Euclidean distances.
#The best results in terms of correlation coefficient were obtained when using
#the Manhattan distance in combination with the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)
#clustering method. However, inspection suggested that the Canberra distance method with UPGMA
#clustering was also possibble.

#We applied bootstrapping Manhattan distance + UPGMA and canberra UPGMA. 
#Both methods exhibit relatively weak performance, as there are no clear statistically 
#significant clusters related to the AML and ALL groups.
